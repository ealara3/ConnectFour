The Testing Report:
	1. First, we tested the functions of the buttons, and if they did everything we were depending on them for.
	2. Drew circles in each allocated space to ensure they were drawn in a proper manner
	3. We made (illegal) moves which should throw errors, to ensure the test cases caught those errors
	4. Performed legal moves to ensure they did not throw any exceptions
	5. Tested clicking outside of the bounds to make sure no additional dics were drawn anywhere.
	6. Made sure that when we clicked on the red/blue circle, it accurately changed the player
	7. Gave the game to two uninvolved people to see if they understood how to play and that they were not confused in how to preform certain functions
	8. Make sure the program gets and sets the player properly
	9. Makes sure the program doesn't take too long to run
